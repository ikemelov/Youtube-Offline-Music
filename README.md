# Youtube-Offline-Music

Written by Liam Kemelov


I wrote this python code to download my favorite
playlists from YouTube and listen
offline. 

In order to run this:
  1. Open terminal 
  2. Go to the project directory by typing cd (path to the project directory) and press enter
        for example: cd /users/liam/Desktop/Youtube-Offline-Music
  4. Execute command:    python main.py
  5. Youtube-Offline-Music interface will pop-up. Enter link to the youtube playlist and where you want to store the playlist
  6. Press Download button to download
 
 It will automatically download the playlist from YouTube and convert it to mp3 extension.
